*************************************
Semi-Analytic Galaxy Evolution (SAGE)
*************************************

``SAGE`` is a publicly available code-base for modelling galaxy formation in a
cosmological context. A description of the model and its default calibration
results can be found in `Bradley et al. (2026) In Preparation`_.
``SAGE`` is a significant update to that previously used in `Croton et al. (2016) <https://arxiv.org/abs/1601.04709>`_.

``SAGE`` is written in C and was built to be modular and customisable.
It will run on any N-body simulation whose trees are organised in a supported format and contain a minimum set of basic halo properties.
For testing purposes, treefiles for the `mini-Millennium Simulation <http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0504097>`_ are available
`here <https://data-portal.hpc.swin.edu.au/dataset/mini-millennium-simulation>`_.

Galaxy formation models built using ``SAGE`` on the Millennium, Bolshoi and simulations can be downloaded at the
`Theoretical Astrophysical Observatory (TAO) <https://tao.asvo.org.au/>`_. You can also find SAGE on `ascl.net <http://ascl.net/1601.006>`_.

Getting started
===============

Pre-requisites
--------------

``SAGE`` should compile on most systems out of the box and the only required tool is a `C99  compiler <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C99>`_.
`GSL <http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/>`_ is recommended but not necessary.

Downloading
-----------

``SAGE`` can be installed by cloning the GitHub repository:

.. code::

    $ git clone https://github.com/MBradley1985/SAGE26.git
    $ cd SAGE26/

Building
--------

To create the ``SAGE`` executable, simply run the following command:

.. code::

    $ make

Running the code
================

The model can be run using:

.. code::

    $ ./sage input/millennium.par

or in parallel as:

.. code::

    $ mpirun -np <NUMBER_PROCESSORS> ./sage input/millennium.par

Plotting the output
==================================

If you already have Python 3 installed, you can switch to the plotting directory, where you will find two scripts, 
``allresults-local.py`` (for z=0 results) and ``allresults-history.py`` (for higher redshift results). 
If you're following the above, these scripts can run as-is to produce a series of figures you can use to check the model output.

.. code::

    $ python plotting/allresults-local.py
    $ python plotting/allresults-history.py


Parameter Optimization with PSO
================================

The Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) framework for automated parameter calibration is now available as a separate package: `SAGE-PSO`.

You can clone the PSO package directly from GitHub:

.. code::

    $ git clone https://github.com/MBradley1985/SAGE-PSO.git
    $ cd SAGE-PSO/

This system allows you to optimize SAGE model parameters against observational constraints to improve the physical realism of your galaxy formation models.

The PSO package includes:

* **Parameter space exploration**: Systematically explores the model parameter space to find optimal configurations
* **Observational constraints**: Compares model outputs against observational data (stellar mass functions, star formation rates, etc.)
* **Emulator integration**: Includes machine learning emulators to accelerate the optimization process
* **Uncertainty quantification**: Provides tools to assess parameter uncertainties and model reliability

To get started with SAGE-PSO, please refer to the documentation available in the repository, which includes installation instructions, usage examples, and guidelines for setting up your own optimization runs.

Extra OPTIONS
=============

**There are several H2 star formation and feedback model options that can be enabled by modifying the parameter file.**

* Blitz and Rosolosky (2006)
* Krumholz, McKee and Tumlinson (2009)
* Krumholz and Dekel (2012)
* Krumholz (2013)
* Gnedin and Draine (2014)
* Somerville et al. (2025)

**There are three options for area calculation in the H2 star formation model.**

* Area = pi * r_disc^2
* Area = pi * (3 * r_disk^2)
* Area = 2pi * r_disk^2

**FIRE feedback can be enabled to run the model with the FIRE feedback physics.**

**Bulge tracking can be turned on or off.**

* Shen et al. (2020), equation 33
* Shen et al. (2020), equation 32
* Tonini et al. (2016)

**Feedback-free burst galaxies can also be enabled.**

**CGM building can be turned on or off.**

**Full star formation histories can be tracked.**

**Parameters can be manipulated in the parameter file to allow for extra exploration, either manually or with the PSO framework.**
